# Welcome to SSDBM 2018
Welcome to the website of the 31st International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management, to be held in Santa Cruz, CA, USA on July 23-25, 2019. The SSDBM international conference brings together scientific domain experts, database researchers, practitioners, and developers for the presentation and exchange of current research results on concepts, tools, and techniques for scientific and statistical database applications. The 31st SSDBM will provide a forum for original research contributions and practical system design, implementation and evaluation, and, for the first time, reproducibility studies of previous publications. The program of the research track will be supplemented with invited talks, panel sessions, case-study papers, and demonstrations of research prototypes and industrial systems. SSDBM 2019 will continue the tradition of past SSDBM meetings in providing a stimulating environment to encourage discussion, fellowship and exchange of ideas in all aspects of research related to scientific and statistical data management.

# Call for Contributions

The SSDBM international conference brings together scientific domain experts, database researchers, practitioners, and developers for the presentation and exchange of current research results on concepts, tools, and techniques for scientific and statistical databases and applications. The 31st SSDBM provides a forum for original research contributions and practical system designs, implementations and evaluations. The program of the research track will be supplemented with invited talks and demonstrations.

SSDBM 2019 will continue the tradition of past SSDBM meetings in providing a stimulating environment to encourage discussion and exchange of ideas on all aspects of research related to scientific and statistical data management.

All accepted papers will be published by ACM – International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS) and will be available in the ACM Digital Library. ![Published by ACM ICPS](Images/ACM_ICPS_v.2B.jpg)
 
### Topics of Interest
SSDBM 2019 will have a focus on high-performance data analysis tools and techniques for large data sets, with a special emphasis on genomics, astrophysics, and high-energy physics. The conference encourages authors to make their experimental results reproducible and include reproducibility experiences in their submissions .

Topics of particular interest include, but are not limited to, the following, as they relate to scientific and statistical data management:

- System architectures for scientific and statistical data management and analysis
- Querying of scientific data, including spatial, temporal, and streaming data
- Mining and analysis of large-scale datasets, especially on new and emerging hardware and environments
- Data flow management in high performance computing
- Techniques for comparing simulation and experimental data
- Cloud computing issues in large-scale data management
- Provenance data management
- Design, implementation, optimization, and reproducibility of scientific workflows
- Integration and exchange of data, including the federation and management of institutional data repositories
- Visualization and exploration of large datasets
- Information retrieval and text mining
- Knowledge discovery, clustering, graph analysis
- Case studies, particularly those at scale-of-consequence for genomics, astrophysics, and high-energy physics
- Stream data management, e.g., storage, organization, compression, indexing and querying
- Stream data analysis, e.g., summarization, statistical analysis, pattern matching, pattern discovery, learning, and prediction
- Modeling and representation of streaming data

### Submission guidelines
We solicit papers describing original work relevant to the management of scientific and statistical data and not published or under review elsewhere. SSDBM 2019 is single-blind reviewed. Therefore, authors must include their names and affiliations on the first page.  SSDBM submissions can be research, reproducibility study, or demo papers:
 
**Research Papers (LONG and SHORT):** We solicit both full papers (12 pages) and short papers (4 pages). The former tend to be descriptions of complete technical work, while the latter tend to be descriptions of interesting, innovative ideas, which nevertheless require more work to mature. The program committee may decide to accept some full papers as short papers. Full papers will be given a presentation slot in the conference, while short papers will be presented in the form of posters. All papers, regardless of size, will be given an entry in the conference proceedings. Authors may optionally include reproducibility information that allows for automated validation of experimental results (see artifact evaluation criteria). Accepted submissions passing automated validation will earn a prestigious “Results Replicated” Badge in the ACM DL in accordance with ACM’s artifact review and badging policy.

**New! Reproducibility Study Papers:** We also call for reproducibility studies (12 pages) that for the first time reproduce experiments from papers previously published in SSDBM or in other peer-reviewed conferences with similar topics of interest (see reproducibility study instructions). Reproducibility study submissions are selected by the same peer-reviewed competitive process as regular research papers, except these submissions must pass automated validation of experimental results (see artifact evaluation criteria). Accepted submissions passing automated validation will earn the prestigious ACM “Results Replicated” Badge and, if the work under study was successfully reproduced, the associated paper will earn the ACM “Results Reproduced” Badge in the ACM DL in accordance with ACM’s artifact review and badging policy.
 
**Demo Papers:** We solicit demonstration proposals (4 pages) which should provide the motivation for the demonstrated concepts, the information about the technology and the system to be demonstrated (including a system description, functionality and figures when applicable), and should state the significance of the contribution. Selection criteria for the demonstration proposals evaluation include: the novelty, the technical advances and challenges, and the overall practical attractiveness of the demonstrated system. Demo papers will also be given an entry in the conference proceedings.

The submission website is https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ssdbm19.  Submissions are accepted in PDF format using the new ACM proceedings LATEX or Word templates. Authors should use the sigconf proceedings template. Please see instructions at the ACM web site: http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html. If you are encountering any problems using the LATEX templates, please contact acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com.

1. Ensure that your camera-ready version complies with the ACM Master Template. Instructions are available at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. You should use the "sigconf" proceedings template. If you have any problems with the templates, please contact ACM’s TeX support team at Aptara (acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com).
1. Use the online CCS indexing tool (http://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm?) to select appropriate CCS concepts for your article. Then, generate the corresponding text/code and include it into your camera-ready version.

  1. Adhere to the page limits: 12 pages for full papers, 4 pages for short and demo papers.
  1. Page size should be US-Letter 8.5in x 11in (around 21.59cm x 27.94cm).
  1. All fonts must be Type 1 (scalable), and not Type 3 (bit-mapped). All fonts must be embedded within the PDF file. See instructions here: http://www.ec.tuwien.ac.at/~dimitris/var/fonts.html.
  1. Do not include page numbers.
1. Submit the camera-ready PDF in CMT (https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SSDBM2018). In addition to the camera-ready PDF, you must also submit an archive (zip or tgz) with the source files (LaTeX or Word).
