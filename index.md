### Submission guidelines
We solicit papers describing original work relevant to the management of scientific and statistical data and not published or under review elsewhere. SSDBM 2019 is single-blind reviewed. Therefore, authors must include their names and affiliations on the first page.  SSDBM submissions can be research, reproducibility study, or demo papers (all page limits including everything):
 
**Research Papers (LONG and SHORT):** We solicit both full papers (12 pages) and short papers (4 pages). The former tend to be descriptions of complete technical work, while the latter tend to be descriptions of interesting, innovative ideas, which nevertheless require more work to mature. The program committee may decide to accept some full papers as short papers. Full papers will be given a presentation slot in the conference, while short papers will be presented in the form of posters. All papers, regardless of size, will be given an entry in the conference proceedings. Authors may optionally include reproducibility information that allows for automated validation of experimental results (see [artifact evaluation criteria](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gvRFgXjkLdRMcpGbYHK136pXZdmVC0u6f-T9n6PKHVA/edit?usp=sharing)). Accepted submissions passing automated validation will earn a prestigious “Results Replicated” Badge in the ACM DL in accordance with [ACM’s artifact review and badging policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging).

**New! Reproducibility Study Papers:** We also call for reproducibility studies (12 pages) that for the first time reproduce experiments from papers previously published in SSDBM or in other peer-reviewed conferences with similar topics of interest (see [reproducibility study instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TdD3W9aU2Crnm5g5cI-nBomY4v0m2jMYRHUVd8qgE-U/edit?usp=sharing)). Reproducibility study submissions are selected by the same peer-reviewed competitive process as regular research papers, except these submissions must pass automated validation of experimental results (see [artifact evaluation criteria](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gvRFgXjkLdRMcpGbYHK136pXZdmVC0u6f-T9n6PKHVA/edit?usp=sharing)). Accepted submissions passing automated validation will earn the prestigious ACM “Results Replicated” Badge and, if the work under study was successfully reproduced, the associated paper will earn the ACM “Results Reproduced” Badge in the ACM DL in accordance with [ACM’s artifact review and badging policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging).
 
**Demo Papers:** We solicit demonstration proposals (4 pages) which should provide the motivation for the demonstrated concepts, the information about the technology and the system to be demonstrated (including a system description, functionality and figures when applicable), and should state the significance of the contribution. Selection criteria for the demonstration proposals evaluation include: the novelty, the technical advances and challenges, and the overall practical attractiveness of the demonstrated system. Demo papers will also be given an entry in the conference proceedings.

The submission website is [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ssdbm19](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ssdbm19).  Submissions are accepted in PDF format using the new ACM proceedings LATEX or Word templates. Authors should use the sigconf proceedings template.

#### July 23, 5:00-7:00pm – Reception at the historic Cowell Hay Barn on the UCSC Campus ####

![Cowell Ranch Hay Barn](assets/images/CowellRanchHayBarn.png)

The original Cowell Ranch Hay Barn was built in the early 1860s as part of the Cowell Lime Works operation. The Hay Barn was an integral part of the Cowell Ranch, housing feed and the animals that hauled logs, limestone, and finished lime. Today the Hay Barn and the many nearby historic structures from the lime works period are part of the Cowell Lime Works Historic District.

The original Hay Barn was completely disassembled and renovated in 2015 to serve as a space for public use and headquarters of the Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems.

The reconstructed Hay Barn incorporates some of the historic barn's heavy timbers and siding, and features traditional mortise-and-tenon framing juxtaposed with modern materials and contemporary design, to achieve a rustic yet visually distinct building. The award-winning result is a beautiful and dramatic signature building with a soaring, spacious interior offering a unique setting for weddings, banquets, concerts, conferences, and much more. See [https://cowellhaybarn.ucsc.edu/](https://cowellhaybarn.ucsc.edu/) for more information about the Hay Barn and its history.

#### About UC Santa Cruz ####

Since its founding in 1965, the University of California, Santa Cruz, has earned international distinction as a university with high-impact research and an uncommon commitment to teaching and public service.

A campus with world-class facilities and one of the most visually spectacular settings in higher education, UC Santa Cruz offers rigorous academic programs and cutting-edge research opportunities that teach students how to think, not what to think. Commitments to environmental stewardship and community engagement are central to UCSC's core values.

From 652 students in 1965, the campus has grown to its current (2017-18) enrollment of more than 18,000 students. Undergraduates pursue bachelor's degrees in 65 different majors supervised by divisional deans of [arts](https://arts.ucsc.edu/), [engineering](https://soe.ucsc.edu/), [humanities](https://humanities.ucsc.edu/), [physical & biological sciences](https://pbsci.ucsc.edu/), and [social sciences](https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/).

Graduate students work toward graduate certificates, master's degrees, or doctoral degrees in 41 academic programs under the supervision of the divisional and graduate deans.

![UCSC Barn](assets/images/UCBarn.png)  ![UCSC Bridge](assets/images/UCBridge.png)

The 10 UC Santa Cruz undergraduate colleges — each a separate community with its own buildings and administration — are built around a core of shared university facilities. These include the main and science/engineering libraries, performing arts buildings, visual arts studios, classrooms, computer facilities, and a complex of highly specialized buildings for the physical and biological sciences, and for engineering. Athletic facilities are provided on the east and west sides of the campus.

UC Santa Cruz is increasing both its enrollment and resources and diversifying its educational and research opportunities. New academic programs are considered and added when desirable and feasible. The campus's physical growth is guided by its most recent [Long-Range Development Plan](https://lrdp.ucsc.edu) which is being updated. In 2013-14 the campus initiated a [strategic planning process](https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/) to identify priorities and published its final report in March 2017.

A number of state-of-the-art buildings have been completed on campus in recent years, including the Biomedical Sciences Building, the Humanities and Social Sciences Facility, the Digital Arts Research Center, and the McHenry Library expansion. A restored and updated [Quarry Amphitheater](https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/quarry-restoration.html) reopened in fall 2017.

UC Santa Cruz continues to move forward with its [Silicon Valley Campus](https://siliconvalley.ucsc.edu/), a multi-disciplinary teaching and research hub that is home to a master’s degree program in games and playable media, engineering faculty, the new office of industry alliances and technology commercialization, UCSC Silicon Valley Extension, and UC Scout.

Go to [https://www.ucsc.edu/visit/index.html](https://www.ucsc.edu/visit/index.html) to find out more about visiting UC Santa Cruz.

![UCSC Library](assets/images/UCLibrary.png)

In addition to the Main Campus, there are several other UCSC places to visit in the Santa Cruz area. A few examples are: the [Arboretum](https://arboretum.ucsc.edu/), [Farm & Garden](https://casfs.ucsc.edu/), and the [Coastal Science Campus](https://coastalsciencecampus.ucsc.edu/).

#### Arboretum ####

Located on Empire Grade one-half mile west of the main entrance to the campus, the [Arboretum](https://arboretum.ucsc.edu/) has extensive collections of plants from the South Pacific and South Africa, other exotic flora, a rock garden, and a eucalyptus grove. Call 831-502-2998 for more information; 502-2999 for Norrie's Gift & Garden Shop; or go to the [Arboretum web site](https://arboretum.ucsc.edu/).

#### Farm & Garden ####

The 30-acre organic Farm, where the [Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems](https://casfs.ucsc.edu/) does much of its work, is located west of the main entrance road. Fruit trees, vegetables, flowers, herbs, berries, and other research crops are used to study nonchemical, organic methods of sustainable agriculture. Similar work is done at the three-acre Alan Chadwick Garden established in 1967 just below Merrill College. Produce from the Farm is marketed from late spring through early fall. Both facilities are open year-round. Open houses and public talks on techniques for growing plants and trees are also offered. For general information, call 831-459-4140; for group tours, call 831-459-3240.

![Late Summer on the UCSC Farm](assets/images/LateSummerOnTheUCSCFarm.png)

![Black Tailed Deer are frequently seen on campus](assets/images/BlackTailedDeerAreFrequentlySeenOnCampus.png)

#### Coastal Science Campus ####

The approximately 100-acre [UC Santa Cruz Coastal Science Campus](https://coastalsciencecampus.ucsc.edu/) — at the western end of Delaware Avenue in Santa Cruz — is at the edge of the Pacific Ocean, three miles from the main campus. Facilities include UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory and its Seymour Marine Discovery Center and Center for Ocean Health; the National Marine Fisheries Service Santa Cruz Laboratory; and a California Department of Fish and Wildlife lab.

The newly constructed Coastal Biology Building is home to UCSC's department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and provides state of the art classroom and lab facilities for undergraduates, graduates, researchers and faculty focused on the study of biology, marine sciences, ecology and evolution, and plant sciences.

The Seymour Marine Discovery Center is open to the public. Visitors may learn about marine life in Monterey Bay and the Pacific through aquaria and other exhibits, including the skeleton of an 87-foot blue whale. Tours offer glimpses of research projects involving bottle-nosed dolphins, California sea lions, sea otters, elephant seals, and harbor seals. For more information, call 831-459-3800 or visit the [Seymour Center web site](https://www2.ucsc.edu/seymourcenter).

_The SSDBM Banquet will be held at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center on July 24th. At that time the Exhibit Hall will be open to SSDBM guests **only** from 5:30-6:30pm. Docents will be available at the Seawater Table to talk about the marine life and the uniqueness of the Monterey Bay._

![Seymour Marine Discovery Center Exhibit](assets/images/SeymourMarineDiscoveryCenterExhibit.png)

Unlike a traditional aquarium, the Seymour Marine Discovery Center takes you behind the scenes to learn more about scientific research in our oceans. Learn more about elephant seal behavior, understand the role of sea otters in their ecosystem, observe the differences in plant and animal life in different tidepools, or learn more about the hearing of sea lions and harbor seals.

![Blue Whale Skeleton](assets/images/BlueWhaleSkeleton.png)

Blue Whale skeleton – this 87-foot blue whale skeleton is one of the largest skeletons of any kind, displayed anywhere in the world. When she died in 1979, she washed ashore north of Santa Cruz near Pescadero, and her skeleton was assembled in 1985. For more, see [https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/exhibits/outdoor-giants/](https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/exhibits/outdoor-giants/)

### Directions

The SSDBM 2019 Conference will take place at the Baskin School of Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, CA.

The conference will be held in Room 180, on the ground floor of the Engineering 2 building, which is located off the Courtyard Area between Engineering 2 and the Baskin Engineering Building (see map below). We will have a tent and registration desk set up outside the room.

![Map of Courtyard Area](assets/images/MapOfCourtyardArea.png)

For additional maps and directions to campus, please go to [https://www.maps.ucsc.edu/](https://www.maps.ucsc.edu/)

**Directions to the UC Santa Cruz campus:** [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) provides great directions to get from either San Francisco or San Jose International Airports. It provides general driving directions from the Bay Area to Santa Cruz and the UCSC Campus. The best routes can vary depending up time of day and corresponding traffic conditions. 

From San Francisco, you should allow a minimum of one and a half hours to drive to the University. From San Jose, it normally takes about 45 minutes to drive to campus. It can take longer to drive from either airport if you arrive during afternoon Rush Hour, normally from 3:30 to 5:30pm

**Conference parking:** Parking permits for all three days will be included with attendee registrations. The Core West parking structure is very close to the Engineering 2 building, and spaces will be available for SSDBM attendees.

![Core West Parking Structure](assets/images/CoreWestParkingStructure.png)

**Directions to the Core West Parking Structure and the Basking School of Engineering:** Hwy 17 ends at Business Highway 1 (Mission Street). At that intersection, turn right onto Mission Street and travel approximately 1 mile north to **Bay Street**. Turn right onto Bay St. and drive up to the Main Campus Entrance. Turn left at that intersection onto **Empire Grade**. (see map below). 

(Note: starting at the entrance to campus, there will be small black and white signs that say “SSDBM” to help guide you along the way.)

Follow **Empire Grade** to the **West Entrance** of campus (there is a traffic light there).  Turn right onto
**Heller Drive** and continue through four stop signs.

A short distance after the 4th stop sign, turn right into the **Core West Parking Structure** (just
before the Heller/McLauglin intersection).  There will be a sign at the entrance that directs SSDBM
Conference attendees to the second or third floor of the parking structure. A parking attendant will be there to give you your parking permit and direct you to a parking area.

![Map from Campus Entrance to Core West Parking Structure](assets/images/MapWestToCoreWest.png)

**Permits are required for parking (you will get a ticket if you do not display one).**

Parking permits can be picked up at the Core West parking structure each morning of the conference
between 7:30 and 9:30am. Event parking attendants will meet you on the second or third floor of the
garage; keep driving until you see them. They will give you a permit to display on your car dashboard and direct you to a parking space. Attendants will have a list of registered attendees, so be prepared to identify yourself
as an SSDBM participant.

The parking attendants leave the garage promptly at 9:30 am. If you need a parking permit, but arrive
after 9:30am or you did not request one when you confirmed your attendance (and therefore are not
on the parking attendant's list of registered attendees), then instead of entering the CORE WEST
structure, please continue on HELLER DRIVE and turn right onto MC LAUGHLIN DRIVE. 

Turn left at the stop sign into the Baskin Circle area (see map below). Follow the road around to the curb area, park in the green loading zone and call or text Lavinia at 408-505-4729. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR CAR. If there is
no space to park, just keep circling or pull over out the way somewhere. Lavinia will quickly send
someone to you with a permit, after which you can retrace your steps and park in Core West.

After you park, proceed to the North Stairwell and walk across the street to the Baskin Engineering
Building. Walk through the Baskin Engineering Building and to the courtyard behind it. The registration
desk will be set up next to a big tent.

### About Santa Cruz

#### History ####

In 1769 the Spanish explorer Don Gaspar de Portola discovered the land area which is now known as the City of Santa Cruz. When he came upon the beautiful flowing river, he named it San Lorenzo in honor of Saint Lawrence. He called the rolling hills above the river Santa Cruz, which means holy cross.

Twenty-two years later, in 1791, Father Fermin de Lasuen established a mission at Santa Cruz, the twelfth mission to be founded in California. Across the San Lorenzo River, in what is now known as East Santa Cruz, Villa de Branciforte was established It was founded by the Spanish as one of three civil settlements or pueblos in California. The other pueblos were San Jose and Los Angeles. Villa de Branciforte later merged with the Mission Santa Cruz community across the river.

By the 1820's Mexico had assumed control of the area and within the next twenty years, Americans began to arrive in great numbers. California became a state in 1850 and Santa Cruz County was created as one of the twenty-seven original counties.

By the turn of the century logging, lime processing, agriculture, and commercial fishing industries prospered in the area. <img src="assets/images/SantaCruzHistory1.png" align="left">
<img src="assets/images/SantaCruzHistory2.png" align="right">
Due to its mild climate and scenic beauty Santa Cruz also became a prominent resort community.

Santa Cruz was incorporated in 1866 as a town under the laws of the State of California and received its first charter as a city in 1876. [[More Santa Cruz History...](http://www.santacruzpl.org/history/)]

#### Downtown Santa Cruz ####

Santa Cruz is a bustling small city of about 65,000 people located at the northern end of Monterey Bay. It is about 32 mi (51 km) south of San Jose and 75 mi (120 km) south of San Francisco.
